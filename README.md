## JavaScript module final exercise: Disney characters finder.
This exercise has been done as part of the final exam of the JavaScript module in Adalab.

## Project description.
In this exercise we have created a web page to search for Disney characters. There is also the option to mark as favorites the characters that we like the most, and those characters will be moved to the favorites section of the page. For this we have used the HTML5 markup language, to which we have applied some styles with CSS3 and we have developed the functionality through JavaScript using array methods, API calls, conditionals, events and their corresponding controller functions, for example.

To develop this project I have used several branches: main, which contains the stable and final version. The other branches have helped me to practice each section adding new features or changes. When the changes were safe, we merged them into main.

The result is published on GitHub Pages.

## Lenguages
- HTML
- CSS & SASS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Tecnhnologies.
For this we have used the Adalab Web Starter Kit (AWSK), created with node and gulp. Thanks to this, we have been able to divide the code into partial sections because ADWSK includes, for example, the SASS preprocessor and a local server.
